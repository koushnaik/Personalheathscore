    <h2>About This Application</h2>
    <p>
        This application helps individuals monitor and improve their daily
        health habits by tracking important parameters such as body mass index,
        water intake, sleep cycle, physical activity, and study productivity.
    </p>

    <p>
        Unlike traditional web applications that rely on JavaScript or databases,
        this system uses <b>C++ backend logic</b> through CGI programs running
        on an Apache server. All calculations, comparisons, and data storage
        are handled server-side using file handling.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each time the user enters data, the system stores it securely and
        compares it with previous records to generate meaningful insights
        and short improvement tips.
